		<h2>Once Upon a Time</h2>
		<p>
			In a quiet countryside near a big forest, a young rabbit lives with many
			other animals. The rabbit is proud of his speed and loves showing off by
			running across the fields every morning. Not far away lives an old
			tortoise who moves slowly but wisely. His shell is old and heavy, but his
			mind is calm and steady like the clear river beside his burrow. One sunny
			day, the rabbit sees the tortoise moving slowly on a dusty path and laughs
			loudly, teasing him for being so slow. The other animals giggle too, but
			the tortoise stays calm. He looks at the rabbit and quietly says, "If you
			think you are so fast, race me tomorrow from this oak tree to the
			riverbank." The rabbit nearly rolls over laughing but agrees, telling
			everyone he will win easily. The news of the race spreads quickly across
			the meadow. By sunset, every animal in the forest knows about it and plans
			to watch.
		</p>

		<h2>The Race Begins</h2>
		<p>
			Early the next morning, the sun rises warm and bright. Birds sing from the
			trees. The rabbit bounces with energy at the starting line while the
			tortoise stands patiently beside him. When the race starts, the rabbit
			runs so fast that dust and leaves fly behind him. He looks back, sees the
			tortoise crawling slowly, and decides he can rest for a while. He finds a
			cool spot under a willow tree and falls asleep, sure he has plenty of time
			to win later.
		</p>

		<h2>The Steady Path</h2>
		<p>
			The tortoise keeps walking, step by step. The sun rises higher and the
			path turns rough, but the tortoise does not stop. He passes ants and
			fallen leaves, crosses a tiny stream, and climbs a small hill that feels
			huge to his short legs. Other animals watch in silence, surprised by his
			steady pace. Hours later, when the sun begins to set, the rabbit wakes up
			and sees that the tortoise is near the riverbank. Panicked, the rabbit
			jumps up and runs down the path as fast as he can. But it is too late -
			the tortoise crosses the finish line just as the rabbit arrives, tired and
			ashamed.
		</p>

		<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
		<p>
			The rabbit lowers his ears and says, "I should not laugh at you. I am too
			sure of myself." The tortoise smiles and says, "Speed can help you win,
			but patience and steady effort truly reach the goal." From that day on,
			the rabbit runs fast but never makes fun of slow movers again. The other
			animals clap for the tortoise and remember the lesson for many years.
